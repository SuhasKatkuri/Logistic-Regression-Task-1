# Breast Cancer Classification Task

This project aims to classify breast cancer data using various machine learning models. The tasks include feature selection, model training, evaluation, and comparison of performance metrics.

## Tasks

1. **Import the Dataset**
   - Import the `load_breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn`.

2. **Perform Feature Selection**
   - Use `SelectKBest` to select the top 10 features from the dataset.

3. **Split the Dataset**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Build and Train the Logistic Regression Model**
   - Train a logistic regression model using the selected features.

5. **Measure the Accuracy**
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the logistic regression model on the test set.

6. **Draw a Table for All Metrics**
   - Generate and display the confusion matrix and classification report for the model.

7. **Draw the ROC Curve**
   - Plot the ROC curve for the logistic regression model.

8. **Compare with Two Other Classifiers**
   - Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier and an SVM classifier.
   - Compare their performance with the logistic regression model.
